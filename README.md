## CSS Color
3 types of decleration 
1. rgb/rgba (red,green,blue,alpha) range: rgb(0->255,0->255,0->255,0->1) decleration: rgba(21,2,40,0.25)
2. Hex #rrggbb range: 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255) eg: #2cf9c4 and #d20 equivalent to #dd2200
3. HSL/ HSLA(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha) eg: hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.2) or hsl(9, 100%, 64%)
  *Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.
  Saturation is a percentage value, 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.
  Lightness is also a percentage, 0% is black, 50% is neither light or dark, 100% is white
  The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all)*
